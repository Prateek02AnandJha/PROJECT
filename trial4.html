        <summary>Q7: Mention the types of Water Management.</summary>
        <p>Traditional water resource management involves controlling water storage and flow. To improve water security in the face of increased demand, water scarcity, growing unpredictability, larger extremes, and fragmentation difficulties, users will need to invest in institutional reinforcement, information management, and (natural and man-made) infrastructure development.

            Resource management, uncertain decision making, system analysis, and hydro-meteorological forecasting and warning all require information systems. In addition to discovering alternatives for improved water storage, including aquifer regeneration and recovery, advanced technological investments to improve efficiency, conserve and protect energy, recycle storm water and wastewater, and establish non-conventional water sources should be considered.</p>

        <summary>Q9: Mention the different Water Conservation and Management methods.</summary>
        <p>The different methods of water conservation are as follows:

            Groundwater Harvesting: It is a method of storing water beneath the ground in order to manage the flow of groundwater in an aquifer and increase the water table.
            Rainwater Harvesting: It is the process of collecting and storing rainwater instead of letting it flow off. Rainwater is collected on the roof and sent to a tank, reservoir, cistern, or natural tanks, among other places.
            Drip Irrigation: It’s a method of irrigation that saves water and fertiliser by slowly dripping water to the roots of various crops, either on the soil surface or directly into the root zone, via a network of pipes, tubes, and valves. When compared to typical irrigation, this method saves more water.
            Dams: Dams are simple hydraulic constructs that operate as a barrier between flowing water’s source and its destination. In the past, these dams were modest and hand-built, but today, new engineering techniques and technologies are employed to build massive dams.
            Water-saving habits: Water conservation can be accomplished through a variety of practises. Take shorter showers instead of long baths, use less water while washing clothes, and mend leaking taps.</p>

            <summary>Q10: What is a Greywater system?</summary>
        <p>Greywater is the waste water from non-toilet plumbing systems such as showers and baths, washing machines, and hand basins. Greywater is easier to recycle and clean than black water since it contains less toxins. In a large water system, the size of the system is determined by the standard and method of treatment.

            To minimise confusion with the mains drinking water, the Greywater system’s pipes and supply points must be clearly labelled.</p>

            <summary>Q11: What is Water Stress?</summary>
            <p>Water stress arises when demand for water exceeds available supply for a period of time or when poor quality limits its use. Fresh water resources deteriorate in quantity (aquifer over-exploitation, dry rivers, etc.) and quality as a result of water stress (eutrophication, organic matter pollution, saline intrusion, etc.).</p>

            <summary>Q12: Define Desalination.</summary>
            <p>Desalination is the method of removing minerals from saline water. Desalination refers to removing salts and minerals from a target substance, such as soil desalination, which is a problem in agriculture. Desalination converts saltwater into water suitable for human consumption or agriculture. Desalination produces brine as a by-product.

                The method can be applied to municipal, industrial, or commercial purposes. Desalination procedures separate water from dissolved salts and other minerals. Brackish, seawater, wells, surface (rivers and streams), wastewater, and industrial feed and process waters are all possible sources of feedwater.</p>
